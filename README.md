# War-Card-Game
Wk6 project for Promineo Tech. Java code for automated War card game.
Is very basic in it's implementation, does not account for the 'war' scenario when ties occur, instead opting to simply award 0 points in the case of ties.

May return to this in the future to optimize and conform the game to an actually simulation of the card game 'War'.
